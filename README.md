# Rolling Rampage
An Eye Tracking Game

Description:

## Comments Here:


Added sounds through two scripts called AudioScript and ColliderDetector. Upon collision with an object, a sound plays.
Certain sounds are limited to player interaction only.
Also, Player ball was, for some reason, either not tagged or tagged as "enemy" in all the working scenes.
The Player Ball's tag was changed to the more appropriate existing "Player" tag in those scenes.
